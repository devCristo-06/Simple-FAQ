### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

On the project I built, it refreshed my memory on the basics of HTML and CSS.
On the HTML side, I used semantic tags to make it more readable and SEO friendly. On the CSS side, I used media queries (for small devices like phones up to larger screens) and more control over styling to equally respect the images provided by the site.
I then tracked my progress using Git, after which I put it in a repo I created to hold everything.

### Useful resources

- [Essential CSS Cheat Sheet](https://devchallenges.io/learn/2-responsive-web/css-essential-cheat-sheet#9.-Media-Queries) - From the official site that I completed the project, I reviewed the media queries of how they were composed and useful lines to avoid using excessive margins and padding
- [W3Schools]() - With this site it helped me to see some points that I did not remember about CSS such as how to use the flexbox model
<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
